*Hey! Welcome to My Blog!*

Here are 26 things about me that can give you a good description of who I am.

<!-- truncate -->

#1 I'm from a small town located southwest of Lubbock, TX called [**Plains, TX**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Plains,+TX+79355/@33.1896697,-102.8479257,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x86fd00933ee3d3ed:0xe2dca25fc4496a10!8m2!3d33.1887135!4d-102.8279888!16zL20vMDEwY2Rm?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Population from the 2020 Census: 1360. Graduating Class Size of 2017: ~30.

#2 I'm a third-generation Baylor Bear with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Corporate Innovation. Here is an [**Instagram takeover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh0VG06SpC8) that I got to do with Baylor that highlighted the student experience.

#3 Before attending Baylor, [**Dr. Pepper gave me $100,000**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7Y3k6ciMA&t=1s), which I thought was so kind and sweet.

#4 I love going to concerts! Here's a clip of Mumford & Sons along with some other phenomenal musicians doing a rendition of [**House of the Rising Sun**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FUriiG9V9U).

#5 I play piano and make music on the side. [**Here's a Clip**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lCGlYMNd8Ko).

#6 My programming journey began in my senior year of high school when I learned how to write programs for TI-84 calculators for a math contest. Here's a link to [**my website**](https://www.brycemcwhirter.com) where you can see more of my programming experience.

#7 I'm currently a Software Developer III at Paycom, Inc.

#8 I like coffee, but I would not consider myself a coffee connoisseur. I actually got fired from a coffee shop, lol.

#9 Here's a list of bands & artists that I think are sick: Twenty One Pilots, Kings Kaleidoscope, Death Cab, Jon Bellion, Fred again.., COIN, Valley [**(fun fact about Valley, through my fraternity at Baylor, we hosted them for a concert that I got to help put on.)**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FMIEjYHPRQ8), Brian Eno, the1975, Maggie Rogers, Leon Bridges, Rex Orange County, Lawrence, & Foster the People. As I'm currently writing this first post, I'm about to head to the Twenty One Pilots concert at the Moody Center in Austin, TX.

#10 The majority of these 26 things are going to be music-related, so get ready for that. For example, one time I met Wallows at Whole Foods at SXSW 2018.

#11 At the time of writing this, I've been considering Catholicism. I'll probably make a post about where I am on that journey.

#12 I'm starting to catch on to this coding thing. This blog that you are on was built utilizing Docusaurus and published through Netlify and GitHub Actions. Coding is a lot more fun when you have a gist of what's going on.

#13 I am from a family of farmers. Our family has a history of growing cotton, peanuts, and watermelon. Every year, our hometown held the watermelon festival, which celebrated the watermelon harvest from our family's watermelons.

#14 I currently live in DFW.....and yes, I go to a lot of shows. Sue me.

#15 Ok, it's the day after the Twenty One Pilots concert, and I'm working on this blog. Y'all........Best Show I Have Ever Been To!!

#16 10 things left. Ok. I like Italian food.

#17 I interned for Walmart as a Product Manager in the Summer of 2022. I got to help the team work on [**implementing digital price tags**](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/06/06/new-tech-better-outcomes-digital-shelf-labels-are-a-win-for-customers-and-associates) across all Walmart stores.

#18 Podcasts I've been listening to recently: Colin & Samir, Tim Ferris (ok like here and there but not every so often), Jackie Hill Perry & Preston Perry, Preston Sprinkle, The Broski Report (#BroskiNation), RuslanKD, Bishop Barron Word on Fire, and the Catechism in a year with Fr. Mike Schmitz.

#19 [**This is one of my favorite videos on YouTube.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7dSXcfVqE)

#20 Here's a [**playlist I made on Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2B8tpYi2u9FvSxgg83ItEJ) a long time ago that got 2,000 saves.

#21 I recently got off all social media, and it's been the best investment of my life. I highly advise the same (or at least limit your screen time).

#22 Every year on my birthday, I record a mini podcast highlighting the past year and what I hope the next year brings. I never share it with anyone; it's only for me.

#23 Most recently, I have become a daily reader. I love to read about theology, self-help, and the occasional murder mystery. My favorite reads right now are _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear (I know, basic), _And Then There Were None_ by Agatha Christie, _Protestants_ by Alec Ryrie, _Confessions_ by St. Augustine, and I'm currently reading _Read, Write, Own_ by Chris Dixon.

#24 I'm watching this video from [**Scott Galloway**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEJ4hkpQW8E). He is a phenomenal voice.

#25 Choose your idols carefully.
