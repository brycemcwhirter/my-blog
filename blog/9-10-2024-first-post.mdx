*Hey! Welcome to My Blog!*

Here are 26 Things About Me that can give you a pretty accurate description of who I am. 

<!-- truncate -->

1. I'm from a small town located southwest of Lubbock, TX called [**Plains, TX**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Plains,+TX+79355/@33.1896697,-102.8479257,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x86fd00933ee3d3ed:0xe2dca25fc4496a10!8m2!3d33.1887135!4d-102.8279888!16zL20vMDEwY2Rm?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Population from 2020 Census: 1360. Graduating Class Size of 2017: ~30.

2. I'm a third generation Baylor Bear with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Corporate Innovation. Here is an [**instagram takeover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh0VG06SpC8) that I got to do with Baylor that highlighted the student experience.

3. Before attending Baylor, [**Dr. Pepper gave me a $100,000**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7Y3k6ciMA&t=1s) which I thought was so kind and sweet.

4. I love going to concerts! Here's a clip of Mumford & Sons along with some other phenomenal musicians doing a rendition of [**House of the Rising Sun.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FUriiG9V9U)

5. I play piano and I make music on the side. [**Here's a Clip**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lCGlYMNd8Ko)

6. My programming journey began in my senior year of high school when I learned how to write programs for ti-84 calculators for a math contest. Here's a link to [**my website**](https://www.brycemcwhirter.com) where you can see more of my programming experience.

7. I'm currently a Software Developer III at Paycom, inc.

8. I like coffee but I would not consider myself as a coffee coniseur. I actually got fired from a coffee shop lol.

9. Here's a list of bands & artists that I think are sick. Twenty One Pilots, Kings Kaleidoscope, Death Cab, Jon Bellion, Fred again.., COIN, Valley [**(fun fact about Valley, through my fraternity at Baylor, we hosted them for a concert that I got to help put on.)**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FMIEjYHPRQ8), Brian Eno, the1975, Maggie Rogers, Leon Bridges, Rex Orange County, Lawrence, & Foster the People. As I'm currently writing this first post, I'm about to head to the twenty one pilots concert at the Moody Center in Austin, TX.

10. Majority of these 26 things are going to be music related so just get ready for that. Like for example, one time I met Wallows at whole foods at SXSW 2018.

11. At the time of writing this, I've been considering Catholicism. I'll probably make a post about where I am on that journey.

12. I'm starting to catch onto this coding thing. This blog that you are one was built utilizing Docusaurus and published through netlify and github actions. Coding is a lot more fun when you kinda have a gist of what's going on.

13. I am from a family of farmers. Our Family has a history of growing cotton, peanuts, and watermelon. Every year, our hometown held the watermelon festival which celebrated the watermelon harvest from our families watermelons.

14. I currently live in DFW.....and yes I got to a lot of shows. sue me

15. Ok it's the next day after the twenty one pilots concert and I'm working on this blog. Y'all........Best Show I Have Ever Been To!!

16. 10 things left. ok. I like Italian food.

17. I interned for Walmart as a Product Manager in the Summer of 2022. I got to help the team work on [implementing digital price tags](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/06/06/new-tech-better-outcomes-digital-shelf-labels-are-a-win-for-customers-and-associates) across all Walmart stores.

18. Podcasts I've been listening to recently. Colin & Samir, Tim Ferris (ok like here and there but not every so often), Jackie Hill Perry & Preston Perry, Preston Sprinkle, The Broski Report (#BroskiNation), RuslanKD, Bishop Barron Word on Fire, and the Catechism in a year Fr Mike Schmitz.

19. [**This is one of my favorite videos on youtube.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7dSXcfVqE)

20. Here's a [**playlist I made on spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2B8tpYi2u9FvSxgg83ItEJ) a long time ago that got 2,000 saves.

21. I recently got off all social media and it's been the best investment of my life. I highly advise the same (or at least limit your screen time).

22. Every year on my birthday, I record a mini podcast highlighting the year in past and what I hope the next year brings. I never share it with anyone. It's only for me.

23. Most recently, I have become a daily reader. I love to read about theology, self-help, and the occasional murder mystery. My favorite reads right now are Atomic Habits by James Clear (I know basic), And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie, Protestants by Alec Ryrie, Confessions by St. Augustine, and I'm currently reading Read, Write, Own by Chris Dixon.

24. I'm watching this video from [**Scott Galloway**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFk5gGbSBas&t=401s). He is a phenomenal voice.

25. Choose your idols carefully.
