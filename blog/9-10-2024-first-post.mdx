*Hey! Welcome to My Blog!*

Here are 26 Things About Me that can give you a pretty accurate description of who I am. 

<!-- truncate -->

1. I'm from a small town located southwest of Lubbock, TX called [**Plains, TX**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Plains,+TX+79355/@33.1896697,-102.8479257,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x86fd00933ee3d3ed:0xe2dca25fc4496a10!8m2!3d33.1887135!4d-102.8279888!16zL20vMDEwY2Rm?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Population from 2020 Census: 1360.

2. I'm a third generation Baylor Bear with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Entrepreneurship and Corporate Innovation. Here is an [**instagram takeover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh0VG06SpC8) that I got to do with Baylor that highlighted the student experience.

3. Before attending Baylor, [**Dr. Pepper gave me a $100,000**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7Y3k6ciMA&t=1s) which I thought was so kind and sweet.

4. I love going to concerts! Here's a clip of Mumford & Sons along with some other phenomenal musicians doing a rendition of [**House of the Rising Sun.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FUriiG9V9U)

5. I play piano and I make music on the side. [**Here's a Clip**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lCGlYMNd8Ko)

6. My programming journey began in my senior year of high school when I learned how to write programs for ti-84 calculators for a math contest. Here's a link to [**my website**](https://www.brycemcwhirter.com) where you can see more of my programming experience.

7. I'm currently a Software Developer III at Paycom, inc.

8. I like coffee but I would not consider myself as a coffee coniseur. I actually got fired from a coffee shop lol.

9. Here's a list of bands & artists that I think are sick. Twenty One Pilots, Kings Kaleidoscope, Death Cab, Jon Bellion, Fred again.., COIN, Valley [(fun fact about Valley, through my fraternity at Baylor, we hosted them for a concert that I got to help put on.)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FMIEjYHPRQ8), Brian Eno, the1975, Maggie Rogers, Leon Bridges, Rex Orange County, Lawrence, & Foster the People. As I'm currently writing this first post, I'm about to head to the twenty one pilots concert at the Moody Center in Austin, TX.
