# If You're Reading This

I have to give credit where credit is due. This file comes from a Markdown Cheat Sheet I found in a [separate repository.](https://github.com/im-luka/markdown-cheatsheet/tree/main) I saved a copy on my end just to have a quick reference to markdown when I need it. -Bryce

# ‚¨áÔ∏è The Only Markdown Cheatsheet You Need

_Here you can find & download PDF version of the Complete Markdown Cheatsheet.  
Feel free to download and use it. ‚úåüèº_

‚úçüèº I've also written, in more detail, some articles about Markdown in general.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

GitHub specific Markdown doesn't support some of the features listed in PDF. Perhaps in the future, they might include it.

üëáüèº If you are interested in GitHub specific Markdown, follow docs below.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to format plain text documents.  
Write docs for your GitHub projects, edit your GitHub profile _README_ etc. You fill find it all here.

Let's dive into it. ‚§µÔ∏è

#### Table of Contents

1. [Paragraph](#paragraph)
2. [Headings](#headings)
3. [Emphasis](#emphasis)
4. [Blockquote](#blockquote)
5. [Images](#images)
6. [Links](#links)
7. [Code](#code)
8. [Lists](#lists)
   - [Ordered List](#orderedlist)
   - [Unordered List](#unorderedlist)
   - [Mixed List](#mixedlist)
9. [Table](#table)
10. [Task List](#tasklist)
11. [Footnote](#footnote)
12. [Jump to section](#sectionjump)
13. [Horizontal Line](#horizontalline)
14. [HTML](#html)

---

<a name="paragraph" />

## Paragraph

By writing regular text you are basically writing a paragraph.

```
This is a paragraph.
```

This is a paragraph.

---

<a name="headings" />

## Headings

There are 6 heading variants. The number of "#" symbols, followed by text, indicates the importance of the heading.

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

---

<a name="emphasis" />

## Emphasis

Modifying text is so neat and easy. You can make your text bold, italic and strikethrough.

```
Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.
Two underscores __work as well__.
Let's make it *italic now*.
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?
```

<a name="blockquote" />

## Blockquote

Want to emphasise importance of the text? Say no more.

```
> This is a blockquote.
> Want to write on a new line with space between?
>
> > And nested? No problem at all.
> >
> > > PS. you can **style** your text _as you want_.

<a name="images" />

## Images

The best way is to simply drag & drop image from your computer directly. You can also create reference to image and assign it that way.  
Here is the syntax.

```
![text if the image fails to load](auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image "Text displayed on hover")

[logo]: auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image "Hover me"
![error text][logo]
```

![text if the image fails to load](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46372998/212541682-9907aaea-5198-45a9-8961-2acc8a98a0db.png "Text displayed on hover")

[logo]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46372998/212541682-9907aaea-5198-45a9-8961-2acc8a98a0db.png "Hover me"

![error text][logo]

---

<a name="links" />

## Links

Similar to images, links can also be inserted directly or by creating a reference. You can create both inline and block links.

<a name="code" />

## Code

You can cerate both inline and full block code snippets. You can also define programming language you were using in your snippet. All by using backticks.

````
    I created `.env` file at the root.
    Backticks inside backticks? `` `No problem.` ``

    ```
    {
      learning: "Markdown",
      showing: "block code snippet"
    }
    ```

    ```js
    const x = "Block code snippet in JS";
    console.log(x);
    ```
````

```
{

}
```

```js
const x = "Block code snippet in JS";
console.log(x);
```

<a name="lists" />

## Lists

As you can do in HTML, Markdown allows creating of both ordered and unordered lists.

<a name="orderedlist" />

### Ordered List

```
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. React
7. I'm Frontend Dev now üë®üèº‚Äçüé®
```

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

5. I'm Frontend Dev now üë®üèº‚Äçüé®

<a name="unorderedlist" />

### Unordered List

```
- Node.js
+ Express
* Nest.js
- Learning Backend ‚åõÔ∏è
```

- Node.js

* Express

- Nest.js

* Learning Backend ‚åõÔ∏è

<a name="mixedlist" />

### Mixed List

You can also mix both of the lists and create sublists.  
**PS.** Try not to create lists deeper than two levels. It is the best practice.

```
1. Learn Basics
   1. HTML
   2. CSS
   7. Javascript
2. Learn One Framework
   - React
     - Router
     - Redux
   * Vue
   + Svelte
```

<a name="table" />

## Table

Great way to display well-arranged data. Use "|" symbol to separate columns and ":" symbol to align row content.

```
| Left Align (default) | Center Align | Right Align |
| :------------------- | :----------: | ----------: |
| React.js             | Node.js      | MySQL       |
| Next.js              | Express      | MongoDB     |
| Vue.js               | Nest.js      | Redis       |
```

<a name="tasklist" />

## Task List

Keeping track of the tasks that are done, and those that need to be done.

```
- [x] Learn Markdown
- [ ] Learn Frontend Development
- [ ] Learn Full Stack Development
```

<a name="footnote" />

## Footnote

Want to describe something at the end of the file? Use footnote!

```
#### I am working on a new project. [^1]
[^1]: Stack is: React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS

Project is about music & movies.

##### Hope you will like it. [^see]
[^see]: Loading... ‚åõÔ∏è
```

<a name="sectionjump" />

## Jump to section

You can give ID to a section so that you can jump straight to that part of the file from wherever you are.

```
[Jump to a section with custom ID](#some-id)

...

<a name="some-id" />

##### Section with some ID
```

[Jump to a section with custom ID](#some-id)

---

<a name="horizontalline" />

## Horizontal Line

You can use asterisks, hyphens or underlines (\*, -, \_) to create horizontal line.  
The only rule is that you must include at least three chars of the symbol.

```
First Horizontal Line

***

Second One

-----

Third

_________
```

First Horizontal Line

---

Second One

---

Third

<a name="html" />

## HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown file. Most of the times that will work well, but sometimes you can experience some differences that you are not used to when working with standard HTML. Using CSS will not work.
